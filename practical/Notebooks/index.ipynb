    "# NGS Data Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial we will introduce several common data formats used for sequence data. We will cover the following formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "__FASTA__ - This format is used to store nucleotide sequences  \n",
    "__FASTQ__ - This format is used to store nucleotide sequences and corresponding quality scores  \n",
    "__SAM/BAM__ - This format is used to store unaligned or aligned (matched to a reference genome) nucleotide sequences  \n",
    "__CRAM__ - This format is similar to BAM but has better compression than BAM  \n",
    "__VCF/BCF__ - This format is used to store sequence variation (SNPs, indels, structural variations)  \n",
    "__GFF__ - This format is used to store sequence feature information (genes, repeats, tRNAs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "On completion of the tutorial, you can expect to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the different data formats used for sequence data (FASTA, FASTQ, SAM/BAM, CRAM, VCF/BCF, GFF)\n",
    "* Perform conversions between the different data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial sections\n",
    "This tutorial comprises the following sections:   \n",
    " 1. [Data formats for NGS](formats.ipynb)  \n",
    " 2. [Converting between formats](conversion.ipynb)\n",
